    <h2>Movie</h2>
      <p>even though i'm not a movie person when i was a kids, i did enjoy going to the movie theater with my cousin and family because it a good place to hangout your close member by leaving the house to watch a new movie title that we never watch or heard about and if the movie good we can watch again but we probably not due to how expensive the ticket are alongside the snack and drink to eat for a hours of reaction. before releasing to pvod. i did enjoy watching good disney and pixar movie from the streaming service called disney plus it made me very entertaiment to watch more movie from the past to the present and yes even though the price has increase on october 12, 2023 it still worth it to sign up.</p>

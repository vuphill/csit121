    <h2>excerise</h2>
      <p>if i want to keep my body strong and skinny i have to do some excerise training, so what i like to do is eating some healthy food such as fruit snack, eating fruit and veggie and drink a lot of water every 2 hours for one day to keep you hydrate. so i try to stay away from sugar and fat to keep my diet going, i have a treadmill at home for me to run at least 40 minute to lose alot of calories and i will try my best to do this running trait every single day for a week before the end of the years.</p>
